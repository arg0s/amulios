        <h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Amul's 'topical' cartoons have been around since the 1970s are now an Indian icon themselves. This is a simple project that offers an easier way of browsing through the cartoon ads than the Amul site currently does. </p>

<p><em>STATUS</em>: A new version of the iOS app has been submitted to Apple and is pending review and publication to the iTunes Store.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>This started with a simple iOS app that displayed Amul 'topical' cartoons over the years, and was first built over a weekend in early 2010 while I was learning Obj-C and playing with Three20. The app was downloaded far more times that I'd expected - several thousands every month and from all around the world, but I didnt get a chance to update it since I'd been caught up with other projects. </p>

<p>Until now. This is a dedication to Dr Kurien of Amul, who passed away a two days ago (September 9th 2012). I've completely rewritten things with two components - </p>

<ul>
<li>a backend heroku worker that scrapes the ads off Amuls site to export a JSON dump that's easier to digest, and </li>
<li>a cleaner lightweight iOS app that enables easy browsing across the years. </li>
</ul><p>I'm opening up the code so that other contributors who like the Amul cartoon ads can join in to help enhance it, or possibly use this for something else.</p>

<h2>App</h2>

<p>The iOS app that lets you browse the cartoons, and provides a nifty picker to go back and forth across the years all the way back to 1976. The new 2.0 update has been posted to Apple and is pending review.</p>

<p>The app requires iOS 5.0+ and XCode 4.3+, uses ARC and Storyboards. It probably also serves as a basic working example of consuming a JSON feed, extending UITableView to build custom cells entirely using StoryBoards, and managing jumps in the navigation using a picker.</p>

<p>The app's repo is here: <a href="https://github.com/arg0s/amulios">https://github.com/arg0s/amulios</a></p>

<h2>Scraper</h2>

<p>Worker task that scrapes the image and caption data off the Amul site, and dumps it in a JSON feed. Workers currently run off Heroku, and dump the feed on Amazon S3. I'm using BeautifulSoup to parse the content &amp; work through a linked list of pages to propagate data upwards for consolidation. Since the Amul ads get updated fortnightly, it didnt make sense in creating a more complex front end for this.</p>

<p>The scraper's repo is located here: <a href="https://github.com/arg0s/amulet">https://github.com/arg0s/amulet</a></p>

<h2>TODO</h2>

<ul>
<li>Improve the icon, artwork and palette</li>
<li>Add sharing capabilities - ShareKit work pending</li>
<li>iPad layout</li>
