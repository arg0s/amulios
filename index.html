          <h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Amul's 'topical' cartoons have been around since the 1970s are now an Indian icon themselves. This is a simple project that offers an easier way of browsing through the cartoon ads than the Amul site currently does. </p>

<p><em>STATUS</em>: A new version of the iOS app has been submitted to Apple and is pending review and publication to the iTunes Store.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>This started with a simple iOS app that displayed Amul 'topical' cartoons over the years, and was first built over a weekend in early 2010 while I was learning <code>Obj-C</code> and playing with <code>Three20</code>. The app was downloaded way more times that I'd expected - several thousands every month and from iPhone users all around the world. However, I didnt get a chance to update it since then as I'd been caught up with several other projects. </p>

<p>That's until now. This is a dedication to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verghese_Kurien">Dr Kurien</a>, who passed away two days ago (September 9th 2012) at the age of 90. </p>

<p>I've rewritten things with two components -</p>

<ul>
<li>a backend heroku worker that scrapes the ads off Amuls site to export a JSON dump that's easier to digest, and </li>
<li>a cleaner lightweight iOS app that enables easy browsing across the years. </li>
</ul><p><img src="http://img16.imageshack.us/img16/8850/photo1sv.png" alt="Amul Cartoon Ads v2.0"></p>

<p>I'm opening up the code so that other contributors who like the Amul cartoon ads can join in to help enhance it, or possibly use this for something else.</p>

<h2>App</h2>

<p>The iOS app that lets you browse the cartoons, and provides a nifty picker to go back and forth across the years all the way back to 1976. The new 2.0 update has been posted to Apple and is pending review.</p>

<p>The app requires <code>iOS 5.0+</code> and <code>XCode 4.3+</code>, uses <code>ARC</code> and <code>Storyboards</code>. It probably also serves as a basic working example of consuming a <code>JSON</code> feed, extending <code>UITableView</code> to build custom cells entirely using <code>StoryBoards</code>, and managing jumps in the navigation using a picker.</p>

<p>The app's repo is here: <a href="https://github.com/arg0s/amulios">https://github.com/arg0s/amulios</a></p>

<h2>Scraper</h2>

<p>Worker task that scrapes the image and caption data off the Amul site, and dumps it in a <code>JSON</code> feed. Workers currently run off <code>Heroku</code>, and dump the feed on <code>Amazon S3</code>. I'm using <code>BeautifulSoup</code> to parse the content &amp; work through a linked list of pages to propagate data upwards for consolidation. Since the Amul ads get updated fortnightly, it didnt make sense in creating a more complex front end for this.</p>

<p>The scraper's repo is located here: <a href="https://github.com/arg0s/amulet">https://github.com/arg0s/amulet</a></p>

<h2>TODO</h2>

<ul>
<li>Improve the grainy icon, artwork and palette</li>
<li>Add sharing capabilities - <code>ShareKit</code> work is pending</li>
<li>iPad support </li>
</ul><hr><p>Note: Amul owns the copyright to all the cartoon ads &amp; images. This project is meant as a tribute and is not associated with them in any way. Source code is provided "as-is".</p>
